# Case Study

For your case study, you will focus on a persuasive design. The design problem does not need to be large. Your problem may be as small as encouraging a user to give feedback during a particular interaction. Or as broad as influencing a user population to stop smoking. <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

Ultimately, your goal will be to affect **behavior** during some interaction.

For your proposal, think about a design challenge where you would like to positively affect or change one or more behaviors. This could be to improve some existing site or application (from work or personal life) or, perhaps, some problem that spans both the virtual world and physical world.

You are not limited to problems involving pixels (e.g., websites or applications). User-centered design involves thinking about the context of interaction such as how people interact with one another, physical environment, and workflow tasks that move them in-and-out of virtual spaces.

> Write a short problem statement centered on the interaction you wish to create or improve.  **Describe your goal, target user population, and behavior(s) you want to change or encourage.**

Don't think too hard about how you would improve this interaction just yet. We're going to work on your problem at intervals throughout this course. You will also learn a lot more about persuasion and how to create persuasive designs. For now, consider the problem on which you will focus.

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: For some ideas of how to frame a problem in just a few sentences, look at [these examples from the nudge blog](https://nudges.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/our-dozen-nudges1.pdf
). Just consider the problem part of the examples -- not solutions.

I have created a [second case study example - tornado warnings](example-case-study-idea.md) - that demonstrates why you should keep your idea simple and not make too many assumptions up front. Next week you will learn about ethnographic research and this demonstrates why such research is important.
