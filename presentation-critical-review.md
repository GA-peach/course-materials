5 points (see breakdown below)


Notes on presentation design:

- Start by watching this video.

- As you know, scientific papers share common structure. But you would not want to present a paper in that structure. And since you are not presenting in a scientific conference (where you should still not be boring), you don't need to present all of the details.

- Even presentations of scientific work are stories! Tease out a story from the paper so that your audience (your classmates) find it interesting and learn something.

- Think of the paper as a layer in an onion. What is the question that drives this research? For example, in the paper, "The spread of obesity in a large social network over 32 years", the ultimate question does not concern obesity, but whether behavior can be considered contagious across social networks. Frame the larger question. Before this question was posed, how did researchers think about the problem? What assumptions were in play?

- Perhaps, give a real world example or a story that pertains. Engage the audience by communicating why this question is important; humanize the science. Sometimes you can get a lead on ideas from the paper itself, and you can can Google the paper to find its place in a larger context, but you can also draw from your own thoughts and ideas.

- Here are some good examples of storytelling in science. Most of these summarize multiple papers, but they'll give you ideas:
    - Do Lutein Supplements Help with Brain Function? (Dr. Gregor) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gBcK_ujNg4
    - Should We Avoid Frozen Fruits & Vegetables?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43FoU_U5jhE
    - Probiotics: Useful or useless (Mic the Vegan) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTx76h5gdHE

- If you find this experience fun, imagine being the Dr. Greger of design!


- 1 point - Mention how this fits to the week's **topical reading**. This is the opportunity to talk about this paper from a "big picture" perspective.
- 1 point - **Summarize the study** (without exhaustive detail). During the course of your presentation, you will probably need to mention something about the experiment design and  participants. But you don't need to have slides with detail. Tailor this presentation to your audience. What would you want to know?
- 1 point - Include a **visual** aid(s). It's hard to talk about experiments without some sort of visual.
- 1 point - Share **your own observations** about this work.
- 1 point - Answer **questions** to the best of your ability (but be honest if you don't know the answer).
