# Case Study

Case studies are a useful tool developed in the social sciences and used in both marketing and design. They are surprisingly effective for communicating elements of a complex problem in a way that stakeholders can easily understand: for our purposes, they comprise a narrative that frame your design choices.

Essentially, a case study is an in-depth study of a particular situation involving one or more people. Case studies are intentionally  narrow, but also very flexible.
We will use this research method to think through a design that you will propose. You will then present your design in a poster session at the end of the course. The elements in this template will ensure that your narrative is clear and compelling.

## Labs

You will gradually build-up and complete your case study template during the course. Many of the in-class labs will directly focus on this. I will add links to these exercises as we go, since this is a new segment of this course. We will also study this TED video and attempt to fill out a template together:
[The nightmare videos of childrens' YouTube â€” and what's wrong with the internet today | James Bridle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9EKV2nSU8w)

This directory is intentionally open for all students so that you get feedback from the class as you go.

## Template

| Fields | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Insight | What is the core insight that drives your design? |
| User Population | What is the well-defined or narrow population that wish to reach? You may also mention the applicability to a wider audience.  |
| Behavioral Objective | What concrete actions (or set of behaviors) do you want to persuade the user to take? |
| Decision Points | When interacting with your design, what choices must the user make? In your presentation, plan to to visually trace the path that the user takes. |
| Other Touchpoints | In what other ways do you have contact with the user, and therefore, the ability to shape thinking? |
| Science | Using ideas from the course, what makes your design persuasive? |
| Feel | What is the feel of your interaction? |
| Evaluation | What quantifiable measures would give evidence that your design is effective? |

## Presenting your design

The purpose of this template is to clarify your thinking. Once you have filled this out and had time to reflect and get feedback from other students, you will create a multi-panel poster (or infographic) that communicates your  design. Consider the poster as the medium by which you will also persuade us, your audience, to believe in your design.
