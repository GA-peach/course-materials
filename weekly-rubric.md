# Rubric for weekly assignments

**Assignments are due before class on the day of class.** Anything submitted after this is late.

Each week will include one or more readings of a topical nature. Students are expected to compose a short journal entry on that topic.

- There are 10 weekly reports.
- Each report is worth 5 points.
- You can miss 1 and still get full credit.

Each weekly report is assessed as follows:

Did you include key learning points from the reading? (1 point)

Did you include references to original work(s) to include page number (where appropriate)? (1 point)

Did you provide at least one example (your own) from actual practice that illustrates one or more of your key learning points? Please try to find an example from design whether physical, digital, interactional, publication, etc. (1 point)

Did your example(s) clearly illustrate key point(s) intended? In most cases, you will need to include an image or something that helps the reader understand your point. (1 point)

Did you communicate with impact? (1 point)

How you might lose points:

- For each day an assignment is late, you will lose 1 point.
- You can lose a point if your entry contains excessive typographical or grammatical errors; think of this is as 'not communicating with impact'.

These assignments are for your benefit: they should help cement learning points in your memory and to tie them to practical examples that you will recall later.

When the class is over, you have the option to fork your journal to your personal GitHub account. You may find this journal useful to demonstrate your ability to analyze interactions from a scientific perspective and communicate those findings with impact.

You should be able to achieve full points on every assignment if you follow the rubric above. I'm not looking for detailed knowledge, but evidence that you understand the material and can relate it to actual examples in practice.
