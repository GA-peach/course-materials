# Participation

There are many ways to participate. I hope that you will engage with other students in discussion and share things you've found or learned.

Please participate in Slack and in conversations during class. We will pick two or three examples from weekly journals each week to talk about.

More than two missed classes and/or general lack of participation will cause you to lose points. If you are shy on Zoom, please be active in the discussion and chat area on the [Slack discussion area]( https://idia640.slack.com/messages/CCB12BTEY).
