# Example Case Study Idea - Tornado warnings

## Problem

Despite the availability of high quality weather predictions and advance warning, every year people die from tornadoes. What can be done to save lives?

## Who will you study?

This is where ethnographic research is important. Who can you interview or survey? Are there people that have survived tornadoes who described why the acted/or didn’t act, or if they were aware/not aware of a warning in a timely manner? Maybe in a specific town or area?

## Before your research

You believed that one solution is to get warnings out faster. Maybe people just don't realize that a tornado warning is in effect.

## After your research

You find out that most people interviewed did have adequate advance notice. You were particularly intrigued to learn that people in Moore, Oklahoma take the threat of tornados much more seriously than in Norman, Oklahoma. In your research, you learn that tornados move by steering winds high in the atmosphere -- and not by patterns on the ground like people think. Tornados are random. So why do people in these two towns act differently?

From your research online (surveys, case studies, etc.), you find that people often head home because they think being home will be safer than being out in the open. Some say that they have experienced warnings, but never been hit in their area. They offer beliefs such as buildings and hills offer protection. In one town, people interviewed said that tornadoes never crossed the highway or river before.

You conclude that people don’t think they are at risk if they've never been hit before; and that home seems safest because they've always been safe there in the past. Your first assumption was not quite right. People actually just don't understand their risk. What can you do? How do you communicate risk better?

## Design Thinking

You decide that you need to find a solution to help people better understand actual risk when tornadoes are in the area — you want to help people imagine what might happen and persuade them that the threat is real.

## Attribution

The idea for this came from Michael Lewis "The Coming Storm" and work he described by Kim Klockow, who works at the intersection of meteorology and social and behavioral science.
